Game Rules: Truth and Truth
Participants:

The game starts with a set of participants whose names are listed.
Spinner Mechanism:

A spinner is used to randomly select participants. The first person selected by the spinner becomes the Questioner, and the second person selected becomes the Prey.
Roles:

The Questioner asks a question that the Prey must answer truthfully.
The other participants can chat in a separate chat feature, but they are not allowed to interfere in the questioning and answering process.
Answering:

The Prey must answer the Questionerâ€™s question truthfully. No skipping or changing the question is allowed.
Turn Rotation:

After the Prey answers, the roles change: the Prey becomes the new Questioner.
The spinner is spun again to randomly select a new Prey from the remaining participants.
Cycle Continues:

The process repeats with the new Questioner asking a question and the new Prey answering it.
